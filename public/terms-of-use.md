## Terms of Use

Be nice. And make sure to read other stuff our lawyers<sup>1</sup> make us say:

- <a href="/terms-of-service" class="view">Terms of Service</a>
- <a href="/copyright" class="view">Copyright</a>
- <a href="/privacy-statement" class="view">Privacy Statement</a>

<li>We don't really have a lawyer. We are just poor students. Besides, we believe in being nice, not in using lawyers.</li>
