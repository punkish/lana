## About

This is Lana, and we are students and other volunteers at [Open Labs Tirana](https://openlabs.cc). We created Lana for two reasons:

- We want to learn how to create the most modern, open web applications that hew to the principles of complete openness;
- We want to make it possible for anyone to get to and use public data as easily as possible.

We call this application Lana in honor of the river that flows through Tirana, and also because we think of this application as making possible a river of data.

Please read the <a href="/legalese">legalese</a> our lawyers<sup>1</sup> make us say.
